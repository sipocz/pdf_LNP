      "What is SFC?  \n",
      "SFC (Sequential Function Chart) enables you to graphically configure and commission  sequential control systems. The sequential control systems are transferred to an automation  system and executed there. A sequential control system allows state-driven or event-driven  execution of production processes based on sequencers. \n",
      "You can use sequential control systems to describe the manufacturing specifications of  products as event-driven processes (recipes), for example. \n",
      "The sequential control system controls the basic automation functions created with CFC via  operating and state changes and processes them selectively. \n",
      "SFC provides two independent variants of sequential control systems for different application  scenarios: \n",
      "● SFC \n",
      "● SFC type with SFC instances \n",
      "SFC \n",
      "An SFC contains the following: \n",
      "● A standardized interface for controlling the SFC through the user program or by the operator \n",
      "● Up to 8 sequencers for formulating the sequential control system (\"gray sequencer\") \n",
      "The sequential control system accesses the basic automation blocks and signals directly and  is therefore not reusable. \n",

      "An SFC type contains the following: \n",
      "● A standardized interface for controlling the SFC through the user program or by the operator \n",
      "● Up to 32 sequencers for formulating the sequential control system (\"gray sequencer\") \n",
      "You can also expand the interface (\"gray interface\"). The SFC type accesses only its own  interface and can therefore be used as often as required as an SFC instance. \n",
      "�������� ���������������������� \n",
      "���������������������� \n",
      "An SFC instance is derived from an SFC type and initially has the same properties as the SFC  type. You can adapt the SFC type to the SFC instance to a limited extent on an instance- specific basis through changes in the CFC or SFC. \n",
      "Criteria for selecting SFC or SFC type \n",
      "You use an SFC when you need a sequential control system that is to be used once and will  control multiple sub areas of the production plant. \n",
      "You use an SFC type when you need a sequential control system that is to be used more than  once and has SFC instances that will each control their own sub area of the production plant.  Central changes to an SFC type are automatically forwarded to all SFC instances. \n",
      "You can use the following criteria in the order given to decide if an SFC or an SFC type is  required: \n",

      "If the sphere of action is large but the sequential control system is to be used more than once,  you still may need to implement the sequential control system as an SFC in certain  circumstances. Reuse is then only possible in the form of copies. In this case, you cannot make  changes from a central location. \n",
      "If the sphere of action is small, you can use either an SFC or an SFC type. Here, the decision  depends on the ability to reuse and to change. \n",
      "What is a sequential control system?  \n",
      "A sequential control system allows the structuring of production processes by breaking them  down into consecutive steps. The steps define the actions to be executed and therefore the  operations required in the production plant, for example: \n",
      "● Switch on motor \n",

      "The passage from one step to the next triggers a transition with a defined step enabling  condition, for example: \n",
      "● Temperature achieved \n",
      "● Reactor empty \n",
      "What are sequencers? \n",
      "You can use sequencers as a higher-level structuring tool that defines state or event-triggered  sub-sequences, for example: \n",
      "● Sequence for production \n",
      "● Sequence for holding \n",
      "● Sequence for error handling \n",
      "You specify the state or event that is to trigger execution of the sequencer in the start condition  of the sequencer. The sequencer itself is formulated as a series of steps and transitions. \n",
      "A sequential control system contains at least one sequencer. In the initial state, its start  condition is set so that the sequencer is processed when the sequential control system is in the  \"active\" state (condition: RUN = TRUE). \n",

      "● State changes when faults occur \n",
      "You can use sequential control systems in the following plant levels: \n",
      "● Device control level (for example, opening a valve or starting a motor) \n",
      "● Group control level (for example, dosing, stirring, heating, or filling) \n",

      "Getting started 4 \n",
      "4.1 How to work with SFC in overview \n",
      "Operating principle \n",
      "1. You create your sequential control system using graphic tools in the SFC editor. You place  the elements of the SFC in the sequencer according to predefined rules. You do not need  to be aware of details such as algorithms or the assignment of machine resources but can  concentrate solely on the technological aspects of your configuration. \n",
      "2. After creating the sequencers as a series of steps and transitions, you proceed to configure  the object properties of SFC, sequencers, steps and transitions, and formulate the  respective properties there. You configure the following: \n",
      "– Operating parameters of the SFC \n",
      "– Start conditions of the sequencers \n",
      "– Actions of the steps \n",
      "– Step enabling conditions of the transitions \n",
      "3. When this configuration is complete, you compile the executable machine code with SFC,  download it to the AS, and test it with the SFC test functions. \n",
      "SFC \n",
      "If you have never before worked with the SFC editor, it is best to begin with an SFC. In this way,  you will develop an understanding of the following topics: \n",
      "● Creating, configuring, compiling and downloading a sequential control system \n",
      "● How the sequential control system works in the AS \n",
      "● How to use commands (such as Start and Abort) in a sequential control system in test mode \n",
      "SFC type and SFC instance \n",
      "Once you know how to implement a sequential control system with an SFC, you can begin to  work with the SFC type and SFC instance. You can then decide which of the two sequential  control systems is better suited for the specific task. \n",
      "The SFC type and SFC instance introduce new aspects of working with sequential control  systems. With the SFC, you can start working directly because an SFC can be generated and  then compiled, downloaded and tested immediately. \n",
      "With an SFC type, you create the sequential control system independent of a specific  application in the form of a template so that it can be used more than once. \n",
      "Then you create an SFC instance, adapt it to the individual application and interconnect it to the  basic automation blocks. \n",
      "SFC for SIMATIC S7 (V9.0 SP4) Programming and Operating Manual, 04/2020, A5E41356228-AD 21 \n",
      "A standard interface must be available for the SFC type in order to interconnect an SFC  instance with the basic automation. You can expand this interface to include new inputs/outputs  or create the required inputs/outputs technologically as characteristics of the SFC type. \n",
      "You then compile the program, download it to the AS, and test the SFC instance. This also tests  the SFC type indirectly. \n",

      "The steps for configuring SFCs are presented in order below.  \n",
      "Procedure \n",
      "1. Create the project structure \n",
      "Create a project structure in the SIMATIC Manager in which you configure CFC/SFCs. You can find additional information about this in the section  How to create a project structure (Page 67) \n",
      "2. Adapt the chart properties \n",
      "You can change the general properties (name, author, comment), adapt the operating  parameters and change the version. By setting the operating parameters, you specify the behavior of the sequential control  system, such as operating mode (MANUAL, AUTO), step control mode (T, O, T and C, etc.)  and other execution options (cyclic operation, time monitoring or autostart). In the chart properties, you can change the option that the chart is to be transferred to the  OS. You can find additional information about this in the section  How to adapt chart properties (Page 89) \n",
      "3. Runtime properties \n",
      "The runtime properties of an SFC specify how this SFC fits in the time sequence of the  processing within the overall structure of the target system. You can change the runtime  properties in the window of the sequence editor for the CFC. You can find additional information about this in the section  Runtime properties of an SFC (Page 160) \n",
      "4. Create the sequencers \n",
      "The newly created SFC already contains one sequencer (RUN). You create additional  sequencers in the tab of the currently selected sequencer using the shortcut menu or you  copy sequencers from the templates of the SFC Library. You can find additional information about this in the section  How to configure multiple sequencers (Page 113) \n",
      "5. Configure the sequencer properties \n",
      "For each sequencer, you configure the start condition and, as an option, the action for  preprocessing and postprocessing and the OS comment, if needed. You can find additional information about this in the section  How to edit sequencer properties (Page 131) \n",
      "6. Create the topology of the sequencers \n",
      "You configure sequential control systems in the SFC editor by inserting the steps and  transitions for one or more sequencers and adding additional elements as necessary. You can find additional information about this in the section  How to create a sequencer topology (Page 112) \n",

      "● In the \"SFC Library\", you can access the \"ChartStates\" SFC with the menu command SFC  Library > Blocks+Templates > Templates. This already contains several sequencers for  state-oriented processing of the sequential control system. You can copy this chart and use  it as an example. \n",
      "● If you want to focus initially on learning the steps from creation to testing of a sequential  control system, you should compile, download and test the \"ChartStates\" SFC (or a newly  created SFC) without any modifications. The SFC is processed in MANUAL mode. In this  way, you can monitor and influence the processing of the SFC in test mode with the  available test functions. \n",
      "● To stop the SFC from being processed \"too quickly\" in the automation system, you can  move the SFC in the run sequence, for example, to the \"OB32\" task. Select the menu  command Debug >Test Settings and select a suitable monitoring cycle for the test settings  in the SFC. \n",

      "Introduction     \n",
      "The steps for configuring SFC types are presented in order below: \n",
      "Procedure \n",
      "1. Create the project structure \n",
      "Create a project structure in the SIMATIC Manager in which you can configure CFC/SFCs  and SFC types. You can find additional information about this in the section  How to create a project structure (Page 67) Note: You can also create an SFC type in a library. \n",
      "2. Create the SFC type \n",
      "In the Component View of SIMATIC Manager , insert an SFC type as a new object in the  chart folder. The SFC type is entered in the block catalog of CFC. Tip:  In the \"SFC Library\", you can access the \"TypeStates\" SFC type with the menu  command SFC Library > Blocks+Templates > Templates. The SFC type already contains  several sequencers for state-oriented processing of the sequential control system. You will  also find the \"TypeCtrlStrategy\" SFC type. It contains a control strategy-oriented processing  of the sequential control system. You can copy these templates and change them to suit  your purposes. You can find additional information on this with the tips in the section: Configuring the SFC type (Page 77) \n",
      "3. Adapt the SFC properties \n",
      "You can change the general properties (name, author, family, FB number, comment), adapt  the operating parameters and change the version. By setting the operating parameters, you specify the behavior of the sequential control  system, such as operating mode (MANUAL, AUTO), step control mode (T, O, T and O, for  example) and other execution options (such as cyclic operation, time monitoring or  autostart). You can find additional information about this in the section  How to adapt type properties (Page 91) \n",
      "4. Create the interface \n",
      "The SFC type already has a standard interface that usually must be extended for the  interconnections of SFC instances with the basic automation. You can find additional information in the SFC online help, in sections  Standard interface of the SFC type (Page 172) \"Inputs/outputs\" interface expansions (Page 179) \"Characteristics\" interface expansions (Page 181). \n",
      "5. Optional: Configuring the characteristics \n",
      "You use the Characteristics editor for the technological configuration of the interface. In the  Characteristics editor, you define characteristics and insert control strategies, setpoints,  process values or block contacts, for example.

      "Open the SFC type. The newly created SFC already contains one sequencer (RUN). You  create additional sequencers in the tab of the currently selected sequencer with the shortcut  menu or you copy sequencers from the templates in the SFC Library (SIMATIC Manager).  You can copy these templates and adapt them to suit your purposes. You can find additional information about this in the section  How to configure multiple sequencers (Page 113) \n",
      "7. Configure the sequencer properties \n",
      "For each sequencer, you configure the start condition and, as an option, the action for  preprocessing and postprocessing and the OS comment, if needed. You can find additional information about this in the section  How to edit sequencer properties (Page 131) \n",
      "8. Create the topology of the sequencers \n",

      "3. Adapt the operating parameters and options of the instance \n",
      "In the CFC, open the SFC instance and adapt the operating parameters in the \"Properties\"  dialog box. These parameters determine the runtime behavior in the AS. As an option, select which of the control strategies specified by the SFC type are to be used  for the SFC instance. You can find additional information on this in the section:  How to adapt instance properties (Page 95) \n",
      "4. Assign parameters and interconnect the interface of the SFC instance \n",
      "You assign parameters for the SFC instance in CFC using the object properties or in SFC  using the \"I/Os\" Interface editor. In CFC, you interconnect the inputs/outputs of the SFC instance to the inputs/outputs of the  CFC blocks or to shared addresses. \n",
      "5. Compile and download the program \n",
      "When you compile the current chart folder, an executable user program is generated  (compile entire program) that you can then download to the target system (CPU). For additional information on this topic, see the following sections: Overview of compiling charts, types, and instances (Page 215) How to download programs (Page 223) \n",

      "One sequencer at a time is displayed in the working window of the SFC. You switch to another  sequencer via the tab at the lower edge of the window. \n",
      "When you create a new SFC/type, a sequencer with the name \"RUN\" and the start condition  RUN=TRUE is created automatically (Note: This corresponds to a chart of V5.x). The start  conditions are formulated like transition conditions. You can find additional information in the  section: What is a transition? (Page 43). An empty start condition – in contrast to the transition  – is evaluated as FALSE, in other words, the sequencer is never executed. \n",
      "In addition to this start condition, each sequencer also contains the \"Priority\" attribute (1 – 255)  that is used to specify the start order if the conditions of several sequencers are satisfied  simultaneously (in the \"Start Condition\" tab of the \"Sequencer Properties\" dialog box). If the  conditions of multiple sequencers with the same priority are met simultaneously, the position of  the sequencer in the tab determines the order of processing in the CPU (similar to the  alternative branch; you will find information on this in the section Processing an alternative  branch (Page 256)). \n",
      "You can also configure an additional action for each sequencer. Each action consists of the  following: \n",
      "● Preprocessing: actions to be executed in every cycle after the sequencer has started and  before the steps and transitions are processed \n",
      "● Postprocessing: actions to be executed in every cycle after the steps and transitions are  processed \n",

      "In SFC, there is initially the \"SFC\" object type along with the \"SFC type\" object type. The SFC  allows the definition of sequential control systems using its predefined interface and any  process signals of the plant being automated. The SFC must first be compiled and then  downloaded to the automation system where it is executed. \n",
      "Basics of configuration \n",
      "The SFC has an interface that is created when the SFC is generated and includes the standard  interface derived from the SFC template (block @SFC_RTS). This is required to provide SFC  system functionality (operating modes, operating states, step control modes, etc.) at the  interface of the SFC. \n",
      "You cannot move or delete the elements of the standard interface. Neither can you add new  elements to the standard interface. You can edit the initial value, comments, and attributes. \n",
      "During configuration, you can use the interface I/Os and any required process signals to  formulate step assignments or the transition and start conditions. Here, textual  interconnections are also possible. \n",
      "The SFC is therefore not self-contained and can only be used once. If you wish to reuse the  SFC, copy the SFC and adapt it fully to the \"new environment\" because the process signals  used must usually be replaced by others. \n",

      "The SFC type is not executable on its own. Like a function block type, an SFC type must be  placed in a CFC to obtain a sequence-relevant object, in this case, an SFC instance. To  execute an SFC instance, both the SFC type and the SFC instance are downloaded to the  automation system. \n",
      "You can find additional information in the section \"Configuring the SFC type (Page 77)\". \n",
      "8.5.2 Configuring the SFC type \n",
      "Introduction     \n",
      "The SFC contains the \"SFC type\" object type, in addition to the \"SFC\" object type. The SFC  type allows the definition of sequential control systems including an interface. The sequential  logic of the SFC type is based only on the interface I/Os of the SFC type. This is why the SFC  type cannot access all process signals, in contrast to the SFC. \n",
      "Overview of configuring the SFC type \n",
      "The SFC type has an interface corresponding to the SFC. It is created when an SFC type is  generated and already contains the SFC type standard interface, derived from the SFC type  template \"@SFC_TYPETEMPLATE\" (FB 247). The standard interface is required to provide  SFC system functionality (for example, operating modes, operating states, step control modes,  etc.) at the interface of the SFC type. \n",
      "You can add additional inputs/outputs to the standard interface in the Interface editor and  additional characteristics in the Characteristics editor.  \n",

      "You can find more information on characteristic in the section: Using the characteristics editor  and the interface editor (Page 99) \n",
      "You cannot move or delete the elements of the standard interface or the characteristics. You  can change the initial value, comments, and attributes. \n",
      "Explicitly created elements can be manipulated as required. \n",
      "During configuration, you can only use the interface inputs/outputs to formulate step  assignments or the transition and start conditions. Addresses in assignments or conditions are  therefore always references to inputs/outputs of the interface. Here, textual interconnections  \n",

      "are also possible. This means the SFC type is self-contained because there is no external  access from the SFC type that bypasses the interface. \n",
      "There are two ways of creating and changing an SFC type: \n",
      "● Creating and changing in a library  This has the advantage that the master for the SFC type is always in the library and that the  test project can still run until a new version of the SFC type is adopted. \n",
      "● Creating and changing in a project  This has the advantage that every change to the SFC type can be checked immediately  because you are working directly with the master. \n",
      "You can find additional information in the section: How to create an SFC type in overview  (Page 26) \n",
      "Configuring runtime properties \n",
      "An SFC type does not have any runtime properties, because it is not relevant to execution of  the program. An SFC type cannot be inserted in the run sequence. \n",
      "Configuring messages \n",
      "You can configure seven messages that must be acknowledged and five that do not require  acknowledgment for an SFC type. The SFC type itself requires the remaining available  messages (one message for each message type and 10 status messages for SIMATIC  BATCH). \n",

      "Tips \n",
      "The following tips may help you: \n",
      "● In the \"SFC Library\", you can find the \"TypeStates\" SFC type with the menu command SFC  Library > Blocks+Templates > Templates. It already contains several sequencers for state- oriented processing of the sequential control system. You will also find the  \"TypeCtrlStrategy\" SFC type containing control strategy-oriented processing of the  sequential control system. You can copy these templates and change them to suit your  purposes. \n",
      "● When creating an SFC type for SIMATIC BATCH, remember the following points: \n",
      "– In Properties >Operating Parameters AS for the SFC type, you need to select the  \"AUTO\" mode, otherwise the control commands from SIMATIC BATCH will have no  effect (this also applies to the SFC instances). \n",
      "– In Properties > Options, you have to set one of the categories, \"EOP\" or \"EPH\",  otherwise the SFC type remains \"invisible\" to SIMATIC BATCH. \n",
      "– If you wish to use the \"Continuous mode\" of the SFC, you have to set inputs/outputs  ENASTART=1 and SELFCOMP=0. You must take into account the READY_TC input/ output when configuring the start condition for sequencers (this also applies to SFC  instances). For additional information, refer to the section: Start requirements of an SFC (chart/ instance) (Page 251) \n",
      "8.5.3 Configuration changes in the SFC type \n",
      "Effects of the modified SFC type \n",
      "Modifications to the interface of the SFC type are transferred to the SFC instances immediately.  Changes to the interface include adding and deleting I/Os and changing data types. You can  only download the SFC type and its instances during RUN mode of the automation system if all  the SFC instances of this SFC type are disabled or if you temporarily disable the SFC instances  during downloading. The instances are disabled during the download following operator  confirmation and restarted after the download, again following operator confirmation. The  execution of the instance then depends on the process state and on the configuration of the  instances (especially the start conditions). \n",
      "Note \n",
      "If you perform the download with the SIMATIC Manager function \"Compile and download  objects\" and the SFCs need to be disabled for this, the SFCs will not be disabled. In this case,  the download will not be performed and an error message is entered in the log. \n",
      "While changes are being downloaded, the SFC instances cannot be processed in the  automation system, and the SFC instances cannot be accessed via the interconnections in the  CFC. \n",

      "You can not only copy individual charts but also an entire chart folder with all the charts it  contains.  \n",

      "Copying within the CPU (in the chart folder) \n",
      "Note the following when copying within the CPU: \n",
      "● Interconnections and cross-accesses between CFCs and between SFC and CFCs are also  copied if the charts involved are copied at the same time. \n",
      "● Chart names must be unique in a chart folder; it may be necessary to rename files. \n",

      "Copying/moving across CPUs \n",
      "When copying/moving charts across CPUs, remember the following points: \n",
      "● Interconnections Interconnections to shared addresses and to runtime groups are not copied unless you copy  a complete program folder including user program, chart folder and symbol table. \n",
      "● Block types Unless all the block types are identical in the destination CPU (name, block I/Os), the copy/ move function is rejected. You must then first copy the relevant block types to the block  folder of the destination CPU and import them into a CFC of the destination chart folder. \n",
      "● Task A task with the same name is used to insert the copied/moved blocks. The system does not  check whether the tasks with the same name on both CPUs actually have the same  properties. If a task with the same name does not exist on the destination CPU, copying/ moving is rejected. You must then configure a task with the same name. If the destination  system is an S7 CPU, the task is an OB number; any name in the symbol table will be  considered as a comment and has no relevance. \n",

      "1. The note texts are configured in the characteristics editor and each text is assigned a unique  number. When the text is created, the editor first assigns the next available number but this  number can be changed to any other number (as long as it is unique among all the note  texts) (value range: 1 to 32767). The numbering can also include gaps. Before a note text can be displayed in the SFC faceplate, the OPTIPNO I/O containing the  relevant note text number must be assigned in a step suitable for the note text. \n",
      "2. The OS can be activated after compiling and downloading the AS and compiling and  downloading the OS. \n",
      "3. You can prepare and start the SFC instance (\"Prepared values\" view of the faceplate) once  the faceplate for the SFC instance is open. When the step used in item 1 is executed, the faceplate displays the note text. \n",
      "4. The note text can be acknowledged with the \"O\" button, whereby the dialog box for operator  confirmation is displayed. \n",
      "5. When the operator action is confirmed (by clicking the \"Yes\" button), an operating message  is generated on the OS and the OPTIPNO output is reset to \"0\" in the block. The value change of OPTIPNO from \"x\" to \"0\" can be interpreted as an acknowledgment if  the SFC type does not trigger this change itself by assigning a value to OPTIPNO in a step. \n",
      "Note: The displayed text is either the comment for the note text or, if the comment was not  configured, the name. \n",
      "Procedure from configuration to using the position texts \n",

      "● The display of note and position texts does not cause a message to be generated and is not  documented in the message system. The acknowledgment of a note text, on the other hand,  is documented as an operating message. \n",
      "● When copying instruction texts and position texts from one SFC type and inserting it in a  different SFC type, the numbers are reassigned. If usages already exist in steps, transitions  and chains then you must check these numbers and correct them if necessary. \n",

You create each sequencer in its own  working window. A tab is created for every working window at the bottom of the screen. The tab  shows the name of the sequencer (for example, RUN or SEQ1). You can switch to the individual  sequencers using these tabs. \n",

      "If you insert or delete SFC elements in the sequencer, its layout is changed automatically  according to predefined rules.

      "12.2.2 How to configure multiple sequencers \n",
      "Introduction  \n",
      "An SFC can contain several sequencers that can be used for different applications. By  specifying different start conditions, you can arrange for a specific sequencer to start when a  particular event occurs. You can, for example, configure a separate sequencer for every  operating state (idle, active, or error, for example) or for every control strategy (heating, cooling,  or tempering, for example). \n",
      "Note \n",
      "Predefined sequencers are already available for various standard scenarios. These sequencer  templates are available in the \"SFC Library\". \n",
      "You can copy these templates and adapt them to suit your purposes. \n",
      "Grouping of sequences into a sequencer \n",
      "If the processing sequences for the \"Run\" state and the \"Holding\", \"Held\" and \"Resuming\"  states are to be grouped into one sequencer as alternative branches, you must set the  RUNHOLD input of the SFC to FALSE. After the \"Hold\" command, the SFC sequencer is  aborted (the currently active step and the END step are run through) and following each status  change, the SFC sequencer is run through again. The SFC sequencer is started again following  the \"Resume\" command. \n",
      "If RUNHOLD = TRUE, the sequencer change mechanism no longer works because the SFC  sequencer is held. The held SFC sequencer cannot be (re)started in the statuses \"Holding\",  \"Held\" and \"Resuming\". The held SFC sequencer is resumed in the held step following the  \"Resume\" command. \n",
      "Start conditions of the sequencers \n",
      "The first sequencer of an SFC has condition \"<SFCName>.RUN=Run\" for the SFC or  \"RUN=Run\" for the SFC type. The start condition of any other newly added sequencer is empty  and therefore unfulfilled; in other words, it will never be processed. In contrast to newly created  transitions that are always fulfilled, a new sequencer must always be given a defined start  condition with the menu command Sequencer Properties > \"Start Condition\" tab. \n",
      "Because it is possible that several start conditions can be satisfied at the same time, you can  assign different priorities to the individual sequencers with the menu command Sequencer  Properties > \"General\" tab, Priority: 1 to 255). \n",
      "Formulate the start condition of a sequencer so that the status of the operating state logic is  checked and the appropriate sequencer is executed when the SFC is in the corresponding  state. You can also formulate any other conditions to suit your purposes. \n",
      "When configuring start conditions, follow the same procedure as for configuring transitions. \n",

      "How to edit OS comments in a transition (Page 146) \n",
      "Examples \n",
      "Example 1: Configure a sequencer with a start condition that queries one of the control strategies of the  SFC. The formulation is, for example, \"QCS=Heat\". If the SFC is set to this control strategy, the  sequencer is executed and is not dependent on the operating state of the SFC. \n",
      "Example 2: Configure a sequencer with the start condition \"<SFCName>.IDLE=Idle\". This sequencer is  executed if the operating state is \"Idle\". \n",
      "Example 3: Any process status can also be queried for the start condition. To do this, interconnect the process status to the external signal \"LOCKERROR\" (input of the  SFC). The SFC changes to \"Error\" state if the problem occurs. Also configure a sequencer for  handling the problem whose start condition is \"<SFCName>.ERROR=Error AND <process  status>=1\", for example. \n",
      "Example 4: As an alternative to example 3, error handling is also possible without a state change. To  achieve this, you configure a sequencer with the start condition \"<process status>=1\" and  assign it a high priority. This sequencer is always executed when the problem occurs and the  sequencer that is currently being processed has a lower priority than the sequencer for  handling the problem. In this case, do not interconnect the process status to the  \"LOCKERROR\" input as this would mean a change to \"Error\" state. \n",

      "The Boolean operators are designed as buttons. By clicking the operator, you can change it  from \"AND (&)\" to \"OR (≥1)\". To make a \"NAND\" from an \"AND\" and a \"NOR\" from an \"OR\",  click the output of the operator. The negation is displayed by a bold dot on the output line. \n",

      "You can find additional information about this in the section \"How to edit addresses in a step  (Page 136)\". \n",
      "The advantage of browsing is that the addresses are then unique. As a third possibility, you can  use a drag-and-drop operation to move the block inputs/outputs from CFCs directly to the box  for the address.  \n",
      "Note \n",
      "Note that an SFC type can only access its own interface and not external objects. \n",
      "As when selecting addresses for the steps, you can also enter the value identifiers of the inputs/ outputs for the transitions.  \n",
      "If you make the selection by means of the \"Browse\" dialog box or using a drag-and-drop  operation from the CFC, the entries are expanded to include the path of the plant hierarchy (if  this exists). The hierarchy path and the chart name are separated by double backslashes ( \\\\ ).  \n",

The textual interconnection is displayed on a yellow background in the  line of the address. The same display is used if a former actual interconnection becomes a  textual interconnection due to subsequent deletion of the interconnection partner. \n",
      "Textual interconnections that cannot be made are ignored during compilation. A corresponding  warning is entered in the log indicating which input/output still has a textual interconnection. An  unmade textual interconnection is also tolerated in the download. \n",
      "Notes \n",
      "● Accesses to CFC blocks can also be modified in the relevant CFC. This modification is,  however, restricted to \"rewiring\" SFC accesses; in other words, moving the access to  another block I/O (with <Alt> + drag-and-drop). \n",

The interconnection is then displayed as a textual  interconnection and cannot be made. Example: The object name of an SFC is the same as  the symbolic name of a DB. \n",
      "● When you enter conditions, they are checked for consistency to ensure the correct syntactic  and semantic formulation of the conditions. The program also checks if the data types of the  logically combined addresses are compatible. \n",
      "● The predefined logic is normally sufficient. If you require more complex formulations, you  can create them with blocks in a CFC and enter the results that were calculated in the chart  as the address in the transition conditions. \n",

      "Procedure \n",
      "1. Open the \"Properties\" dialog box of the desired step or transition/sequencer in the SFC  Editor.  In the \"Properties\" dialog box, change to the tab in which you want to configure the  calculation in a statement line, e.g. \"Condition\" tab. \n",
      "2. In the statement line next to the field in which you want to insert the calculation, click the  associated \"f(x)\" button. The \"Calculation for SFC\" dialog box opens. For configuring a calculation, the associated text box in the statement line must be empty.  Otherwise, the associated \"f(x)\" icon is deactivated.  In this case, delete the content of the field and then click the associated \"f(x)\" button to  configure the calculation.  \n",
      "3. The uppermost cell in the \"Calculation\" column contains the name of the calculation. If the  calculation is being newly created, the uppermost cell contains the text \"Please insert a  function\".  The top cell can only be edited when a function has been added.  Select the shortcut menu command \"Insert function\" and one of the displayed functions for  this. The selected function is inserted in the \"Calculation\" column. This uppermost function  that was inserted first always represents the highest level of the structure or calculation. If  necessary, this function can also be replaced later.  You can find additional information about the functions and data types available for selection  in the section \"Scope of functions in SFC calculations: (Page 156)\". \n",
      "4. Enter a name for the calculation in the top cell.  Various editing functions are available in the shortcut menu of the cell. The name is  transferred to the higher-level properties dialog box of the step or transition.  When you leave this cell, a plausibility check is performed, for example, for uniqueness,  permissible characters and character length. Non-unique names are made unique when the  data is entered in the higher-level properties dialog box, for example, by adding \"(1)\". \n",
      "5. Complete the configuration of the first inserted function.  After you insert a function, the following associated data must be configured at each function  input:  \n",
      "– The desired data type in the \"Data type\" column (see step 6).    \n",
      "– An interconnection, constant or lower-level function in the \"Interconnection\" column (see  step 7). \n",
      "The order in which these configuration steps are performed may vary. For example, if you  want to insert lower-level functions, it makes sense to define the data types afterwards.           \n",
      "6. Check for the desired data type in the \"Data Type\" column for the associated function inputs  and change the data type, if necessary.  If only one data type is possible for a function input, the associated cell in the table is shown  with \"Gray\" background color. If, on the other hand, multiple data types are possible, the  desired data type can be selected from a drop-down list and the background color of the cell  is \"White\".   \n",

      "154 Programming and Operating Manual, 04/2020, A5E41356228-AD \n",
      "7. At a function input, select the associated cell in the \"Interconnection\" column. The address  for the function input is configured in this cell.  The following options are available for configuring an address:  \n",
      "– Manual entry: For manual entry, such as for configuring constants or textual interconnections, there are  various functions available in the shortcut menu for the cell.   \n",
      "– When a calculation is configured in an SFC:  The desired variable or block I/O can be moved from an open CFC to the  \"Interconnection\" cell of the calculation using drag-and-drop. The \"Browse...\" button can be used to open a dialog box for selecting an address for the  selected function input.  \n",
      "– When a calculation is configured in an SFC type:  Only the interface of the SFC type can be accessed for selecting addresses. In this case,  a characteristic can be moved from the characteristic list or an I/O from the I/O list of the  SFC type to the \"Interconnection\" cell of the calculation using drag-and-drop. \n",
      "8. If you want to integrate an additional function in the calculation, select a function input in the  \"Calculation\" column and select the new function in the shortcut menu. A lower-level  function can be inserted even for an interconnected function input. The previous entry in this  cell is then replaced.  If needed, you can also add further function inputs for certain functions via the shortcut  menu.   After this function is inserted, it becomes a subordinate level. The maximum nesting depth  is limited to 8 subordinate levels.  The uppermost function that was inserted first is always the highest level of the structure.  The second level and all other levels can then also constitute multiple functions that are  configured at the function inputs of the next higher level in each case.  \n",
      "9. You can also replace or delete functions, if required. To do so, select the desired function  in the \"Calculation\" column and select the corresponding menu command in the shortcut  menu.  When a function is being replaced, the selection displayed in the shortcut menu depends on  the new function having similar properties to the function to be replaced.  \n",

      "10.Check the \"Data Type\" column. An explicit data type must be specified for all function inputs/ results in the calculation in order for the calculation data to be transferred to the properties  dialog box of the step or transition. Thus, no cell of the \"Data Type\" column may have  \"White\" background color. If there are still cells with \"White\" background color, you must  manually specify the data type. To do so, select the \"Data Type\" cell of a function input whose data type is not yet explicitly  specified and therefore has \"White\" background color.  Select the desired data type in the drop-down list of the cell.  The shortcut menu for this selected cell contains the menu commands for specifying the  data type and canceling the specification. Select the shortcut menu command \"Specify data type\". After manual specification of the  data type, the cell is displayed with \"Dark gray\" background color. If you want to change the  data type again, you can cancel the specification using the corresponding shortcut menu  command.  Repeat the step for all other cells whose data type is not specified and whose background  color is \"White\".  \n",
      "11.When all desired functions are configured and the data types are explicitly specified, the  calculation data can be transferred to the properties dialog box of the step or transition.  To do this, click the \"Apply\" button. The \"Calculation for SFC\" dialog box closes.  The calculation is displayed in the statement line of the properties dialog box of the step or  transition with the name entered in the calculation.  \n",

The SFC is executed as often as specified by \"n\",  in each case offset by \"m\" units of the task cycle. \"m\" is an integer, where 0 <= m <= (n-1). Example: Basic cycle of a cyclic interrupt: 500 ms Reduction ratio: 16 (which means the SFC is processed every 8 s) phase offset: 3. The SFC is thus processed after 1.5 s; 9.5 s; 17.5 s, etc. If a chart is not installed in a runtime group, the number 0 is preset; in other words, the SFC  is processed without phase offset. \n",
      "Note \n",
      "You should only use reduction ratio and phase offset in the tasks that are executed in defined  cycles; in other words, in (cyclic) interrupt tasks. In all other tasks you should use extreme  caution, particularly in process interrupt tasks and special tasks. Here, you should not change  the default reduction ratio=1 and phase offset=0. \n",

Disabling before the download and enabling after the download  is handled by the download program following positive acknowledgment of a prompt.  Otherwise, the download is aborted. If you perform the download with the SIMATIC Manager function \"Compile and Download  Objects\", the SFCs are not automatically disabled. In this case, the download will not be  performed and an error message is entered in the log. \n",
      "● Modifications to the interface of the SFC type are transferred to the SFC instances  immediately. For this reason, the SFC instances must be disabled during the downloads  and execution must be suspended in the CPU.

      "Execution options of the SFC \n",
      "● Command output If \"Command Output: on\" is set, the actions of active steps are processed; if \"Command  Output: off\" is set, they are not processed. During commissioning, or if errors occur, blocking the command output in conjunction with  suitable step control modes (\"C\", \"T or C\") can bring the sequential control system to a  defined state without affecting the process. \n",

      "– Changing the command output first takes effect after transition to the next step.  Therefore, either all actions or no actions of a step are executed. \n",
      "● Cyclic operation If \"Cyclic Operation: on\" is set, execution is resumed automatically with \"Starting\" state after  \"Completed\" state. A sequencer that is to be processed in \"Completed\" state is exited again immediately in  cyclic operation. Only the start step and final step are processed. \n",
      "– If you are working in MANUAL mode and using SFC inputs/outputs for state control,  SELFRESET = 0 must be set in cyclic operation. \n",

This behavior applies to all operating states that can be exited only by means of commands. You can find information on operating modes in the section: Operating state logic for SFC (SFC OSL) (Page 236) \n",
      "● Time monitoring If \"Time Monitoring: on\" is set, after a step has been enabled the active time (\"Current run  time\") of the step is continuously compared with the monitoring time (\"Maximum run time\")  and a step error is reported if the time is exceeded.  An acknowledgment of the step error does not complete this step. If the active sequencer is stopped and RUNHOLD = 0, then the following applies:  \n",

An automatic start does not  occur after downloading changes (CPU does not go to STOP). The SFC must be restarted  by the operator or via the program (for example, from the external view in the CFC).

      "Introduction \n",
      "In the following description of the basic principles of cyclic operation of an SFC, it is assumed  that the SFC contains several sequencers with user-defined start conditions. \n",
      "How it works \n",
      "The SFC is executed based on the input signals pending in the SFC interface and the internal  status of the SFC. After an entire chart folder has been downloaded to the automation system,  all the SFCs are in \"Idle\" state or \"Starting\" state if Autostart = 1 is set. The following is checked: \n",
      "● The operating mode, commands, and external and internal signals are checked. This  determines the state that the SFC should take based on the input signals. \n",
      "● All start conditions of the sequencers are checked. This determines which sequencer is to  be processed based on the preceding checks. \n",
      "SFC operating mode unchanged \n",
      "If the SFC status is unchanged, the sequencer whose start condition is fulfilled and has the  highest priority of all sequencers with a fulfilled start condition is executed. If there are several  sequences with a fulfilled start condition and the same priority, then the sequencer with the tab  furthest left in the editor is executed (similar to the execution of alternative branches). If the  sequencer that was processed up to now is different from the sequencer that is to start  processed now, the previous sequencer is aborted and the new sequencer starts. \n",
      "The start condition triggers the start of a sequencer. While the sequencer is being processed,  it is not necessary for the start condition to remain fulfilled. The sequencer is processed until it  is completed or until a sequencer with a higher priority and fulfilled start condition has to be  processed or the sequencer is aborted or held due to a operating mode transition. \n",
      "In the \"Idle\", \"Completed\", \"Aborted\", \"Stopped\", \"Held\", \"Held (Error)\", \"Error\" and \"Run\" states  (when SELFCOMP=0), sequencers are processed until you exit the state by means of a  command. A sequencer can, therefore, be repeated any number of times when the  corresponding start condition is fulfilled and no command is pending. To prevent this behavior,  you can configure the final transition of the sequencer with an unfulfilled condition. This causes  the sequencer to \"hang\" at this transition and to exit only following a command. \n",
      "SFC operating mode changed \n",
      "If the SFC operating mode has changed, the SFC processes the previous sequencer and the  new sequencer according to the state change that has taken place: \n",
      "When an operating mode transition from \"Run\" to \"Holding\" is performed, the active sequencer  is held (with RUNHOLD = 0) or aborted (with RUNHOLD = 1) and the new sequencer is started.  \n",

      "If the previous sequencer has been completely processed, the state changes from \"Resuming\"  or \"Resuming (Error)\" to \"Run\". The new sequencer is resumed (with RUNHOLD = 0) or started  (with RUNHOLD = 1) at the transition from \"Resuming\" and is started at the transition from  \"Resuming (Error)\". \n",
      "If there is an implicit state change, the change is executed when the sequencer of the first  transitional state has been processed completely and is therefore terminated. If there is no  sequencer with a fulfilled start condition, the implicit change is executed immediately and the  new sequencer starts. \n",
      "With all other state changes resulting from commands, external or internal signals, the previous  sequencer is aborted if it has not yet been processed completely and the new sequencer starts. \n",
      "Notes on operating mode transitions \n",
      "● When a sequencer is held, the running step is held immediately after the execution phase.  The following when resuming the sequencer: \n",
      "– When the transition is fulfilled, the step is resumed after the execution phase. \n",
      "– When the transition is not fulfilled, the resumption occurs with the execution phase of the  step. \n",
      "● When a sequencer aborts, the active steps are always processed completely followed by  the final step. The completion of the active steps and the initialization or processing of the  final step are processed in one cycle. \n",
      "● A sequencer can be processed in an SFC even if the SFC has not received a start  command. This is then the case when, for example, in the status \"Idle\" the start condition of  one or several sequencers is fulfilled or sequencers exist, whose starting conditions are  indicated independently of states. \n",
      "You can find more information on this in the sections \"Inputs/outputs of the SFC type standard  interface (Page 172)\" and \"Operating state logic for SFC (SFC OSL) (Page 236)\".  \n",
      "Coordination of sequencers and target steps \n",
      "You can influence the start behavior of a sequencer that will become active in the future by  setting a target step for this sequencer in step actions of the current sequencer (for example  <SFCName>.TARGETSEQ:=2; <SFCName>.TARGETSTEP:=5). This corresponds to setting  a target step manually during testing and commissioning; however, the difference in this case  is that all other target steps of the sequencer including those set manually are reset. This means  that you can specify the required start step for the sequencer to be started at any time. \n",
      "TARGETSEQ = 0 is set when the step action has been executed. \n",
      "Note that target steps cannot be set in simultaneous branches. \n",
      "Example: By setting <SFCName>.TARGETSEQ:=2 and <SFCName>.TARGETSTEP:=0, all  the target steps in the sequencer with number 2 are cleared. \n",
      "A target step is taken into account when a sequencer starts or resumes and is then deleted. \n",
      "Because the required execution and the target step both generally depend on the prior  execution of the SFC, you can query the last active sequencer and the last active step in a  transition condition (for example <SFCName>.LASTSEQ:=3; <SFCName>.LASTSTEP:=2) to  set different target steps depending on the result of the query. \n",

      "● The SFC sets the output QOCCUPIED = 1 and the occupied code (bit 24) for BA_STATE. \n",
      "● OCCUPIED and QOCCUPIED are set with SFC = 0 for a reset (transition to \"Idle\"). When OCCUPIED is deleted by SIMATIC BATCH itself, the QPARAM = 0 output is also set.

      "Changing control strategy and setpoints \n",
      "There are two mechanisms for changing the control strategy and/or setpoints: \n",
      "1. Changing the control strategy and/or setpoints and applying them at the next start \n",
      "In AUTO mode, proceed as follows: Use the PARAM and START inputs/outputs. The CS inputs for the control strategy and  <setpoint> for the setpoints are assigned the new values and then PARAM input = 1 is set.  The QPARAM output signals that a change of control strategy and/or setpoints at the next  start has been requested; the output is reset after the start. When the SFC instance starts,  the control strategy and/or setpoints are applied. In MANUAL mode, follow the steps outlined below: Set the appropriate enables for changing the control strategy ENCSP or the setpoints  <setpoint>_ENOPP, to allow changes to be performed. This enables the corresponding  input options in the faceplate for SFC instances. The inputs CSP_OP for the control strategy and <setpoint>_OPP for the setpoints are  assigned the new values. You can do this in CFC Test mode directly in the SFC instance or  in the faceplate of the SFC instance in the \"Prepared values\" tab. The control strategy and/ or setpoints are applied when the start is executed.  If the values are valid, they are displayed at the outputs QCSP for the control strategy and  <setpoint>_QP for the setpoints in both modes. If the limits for the control strategy or  setpoints are exceeded, this is displayed at the corresponding outputs <setpoint>_ERR.  Invalid values are not applied to the outputs QCSP or <setpoint>_QP. After the start, the  current control strategy is displayed at the QCS output and the current setpoints at the  <setpoint>_Q outputs (QCS = QCSP, \"sw\"_Q = \"sw\"_QP). \n",
      "2. Changing setpoints and applying them immediately \n",
      "This mechanism cannot be used to change the control strategy. In AUTO mode, proceed as follows: Use the TAKESP input/output. The inputs <setpoint> for the setpoints are assigned the new  value and the TAKESP input is set. The setpoints are adopted immediately if the TAKESP  input is set and no error has been found in the setpoints (high/low limit). The QTAKESP  output signals that an immediate change of setpoints was requested.  The PARAM signal must always be set when setpoint changes are made because the  setpoints are checked and adopted in the prepared values only when PARAM is set. Only  checked values are applied at START or TAKESP. In MANUAL mode, follow the steps outlined below: You must set the appropriate enables for changing the setpoints <setpoint>_ENOP to allow  changes to be made. This enables the corresponding input options in the faceplate for SFC  instances. The <setpoint>_OP inputs for the setpoints are assigned the new values. You can do this in  CFC Test mode directly in the SFC instance or in the faceplate of the SFC instance in the  \"Current values\" tab. The setpoints are applied immediately. Note on working in the faceplate: The control of setpoints must be enabled on the \"Current  values\" page. The '\"Current setpoints\" can be used page' property must be selected in the  \"@pg_@sfc_type_actualsp.pdl\" faceplate subimage. You can find additional information on this in the online help of SFC Visualization. Assuming the values are valid, they are displayed at the <setpoint>_Q outputs for the  setpoints in both modes. If the limits for the control strategy or setpoints have been  exceeded (error case), this is displayed at the corresponding outputs <setpoint>_ERR.  Invalid values are not applied at the <setpoint>_Q outputs. \n",

      "Summary \n",
      "In both mechanisms, the output CSSPACCEPT indicates whether or not the requested  changes were applied. This output is set after applying the control strategy and/or setpoints by  the SFC instance at the relevant outputs. The CSSPACCEPT output is set for one processing  cycle (for 1.) or remains set until the TAKESP request is reset (for 2.). \n",
      "Output LI_ERR indicates whether or not an error occurred when attempting to apply value  changes with the result that the values could not be completely applied. If LI_ERR is set,  QDIS_START is not reset and a start and, thus, the adoption of the control strategy and/or  setpoints is prevented (for 1.). \n",

      "Overview \n",
      "Debug functions are integrated in the SFC Editor for the following tasks to provide support for  commissioning: \n",
      "● Monitoring the work process of the sequential control system in the AS \n",
      "● Influencing the operating modes \n",
      "● Changing setpoints \n",
      "Test modes \n",
      "You can start test mode in either of the following test operating modes: \n",
      "● Process mode \n",
      "● Laboratory mode \n",
      "You can select the test operating mode while in edit mode using the menu commands in the  \"Debug\" menu. You cannot switch once you are in test mode. \n",
      "In process mode, the communication for the online dynamic display of the SFCs and SFC  instances is restricted to keep the load on the CP and bus to a minimum. If overload occurs in  this test operating mode, a message is displayed indicating that the limit of the bus load has  been reached. In this case, stop the testing of the SFCs that are not absolutely necessary for  the test. \n",
      "In laboratory mode, communication for the online dynamic updates of the SFCs is unrestricted.  Use laboratory mode to perform convenient and efficient testing and commissioning. \n",
      "Setting the test environment \n",
      "With the menu command Debug > Test Settings..., you can open a dialog box in which you can  change the monitoring cycle for the current program (default: 2 s). \n",
      "The cycle time is uniformly stored with the CFC in the chart folder. This means that the same  monitoring cycle is valid for both applications (SFC and CFC). \n",
      "Note \n",
      "If the cycle time is changed in the SFC, this affects charts/instances with dynamic properties.  A change in the CFC affects only newly registered SFCs/instances. \n",
      "SFC for SIMATIC S7 (V9.0 SP4) Programming and Operating Manual, 04/2020, A5E41356228-AD 263 \n",
      "Requirements \n",
      "● The sequential control system (chart or instance) to be tested including the necessary basic  automation functions (CFCs) have been compiled without errors and downloaded to the  CPU. \n",
      "● The chart is open in SFC or SIMATIC Manager, the SFC instance is open in the CFC. \n",
      "Note \n",
      "With S7, loading into the CPU—and working in test mode—are functions that are logged if  the SIMATIC Logon Service is installed and the access protection and change log are  activated. \n",

      "You change from edit mode to test mode. \n",
      "You can switch back to edit mode at any time during testing. \n",
      "Note \n",
      "Make sure that the sequential control system is not waiting for operator input when you switch  to edit mode. \n",
      "The mode switch always relates to the currently active SFC. The overview display of this SFC  is dynamically and cyclically updated. \n",
      "After you have switched to test mode, the current state of the sequential control system is  displayed. This does not mean that a sequential control system that has already started can  necessarily be monitored or controlled from the start. For example, this is the case with  sequential control systems that are started immediately after they are downloaded to the AS  without requiring any operator command (autostart). \n",
      "Note \n",
      "If the H CPU is being operated in solo mode, for example, due to CPU failure, and a CPU  failover has taken place, if there is online access (here: Activate Test Mode), a selection dialog  box is displayed. In this dialog box, you can select the required CPU. In redundant operation,  this dialog box does not appear. \n",

All colors that occur are listed in the following table: Default colors (Page 65). If you select the \"Confirmation\" check box, you set a flag that is evaluated in the \"T/T and C\"  step control mode (step-specific confirmation by operator). This can only be modified in the  SFC. The sequential control system runs as follows:  \n",
      "– Process-driven for steps without the \"Confirmation\" option.  Each fulfilled successor transition of a step without the \"Confirmation\" option enables the  next step without operator intervention (corresponds to \"T\"). \n",
      "– Controlled by the operator for steps with the \"Confirmation\" option. When an active step with the \"Confirmation\" option becomes true, the system prompts  the operator to acknowledge the next step and then continues the sequencer  (corresponds to \"T and O\"). \n",

      "The target step marker is valid only for the next \"Start\" or \"Resume\" command. When these  commands are executed or when the CPU is restarted, the target step marker is cleared. You can also select several steps as the target step.
